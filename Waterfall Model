Waterfall Model  model has five phases: 
Requirements analysis and specification, 
design, 
implementation, and 
unit testing, 
integration and system testing, and 
operation and maintenance. 
The steps always follow in this order and do not overlap. 
The developer must complete every phase before the next phase begins. 
This model is named "Waterfall Model", because its diagrammatic representation resembles a cascade of waterfalls.

Requirements analysis and specification phase: 
The aim of this phase is to understand the exact requirements of the customer and to document them properly. 
Both the customer and the software developer work together so as to document all the functions, performance, and interfacing requirement of the software.


Design Phase: 
This phase aims to transform the requirements gathered in the SRS into a suitable form which permits further coding in a programming language. 
It defines the overall software architecture together with high level and detailed design.
All this work is documented as a Software Design Document (SDD).


Implementation and unit testing: 
During this phase, design is implemented. 
If the SDD is complete, the implementation or coding phase proceeds smoothly, because all the information needed by software developers is contained in the SDD.


Integration and System Testing: This phase is highly crucial as the quality of the end product is determined by the effectiveness of the testing carried out.
The better output will lead to satisfied customers, lower maintenance costs, and accurate results. 
Unit testing determines the efficiency of individual modules.

Operation and maintenance phase: Maintenance is the task performed by every user once the software has been delivered to the customer, 
installed, and operational.
