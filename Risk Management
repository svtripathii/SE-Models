A software project can be concerned with a large variety of risks. 
In order to be adept to systematically identify the significant risks which might affect a software project, 
it is essential to classify risks into different classes. The project manager can then check which risks from each class are relevant to the project.

There are three main classifications of risks which can affect a software project:

    Project risks
    Technical risks
    Business risks

1. Project risks: Project risks concern differ forms of budgetary, schedule, personnel, resource, and customer-related problems. 
A vital project risk is schedule slippage. Since the software is intangible, it is very tough to monitor and control a software project. 
It is very tough to control something which cannot be identified. For any manufacturing program, such as the manufacturing of cars, 
the plan executive can recognize the product taking shape.

2. Technical risks: Technical risks concern potential method, implementation, interfacing, testing, and maintenance issue. 
It also consists of an ambiguous specification, incomplete specification, changing specification, technical uncertainty, and technical obsolescence. 
Most technical risks appear due to the development team's insufficient knowledge about the project.

3. Business risks: This type of risks contain risks of building an excellent product that no one need, 
losing budgetary or personnel commitments, etc.
