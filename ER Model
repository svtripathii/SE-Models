ER-modeling is a data modeling method used in software engineering to produce a conceptual data model of an information system.
Diagrams created using this ER-modeling method are called Entity-Relationship Diagrams or ER diagrams or ERDs.

Purpose of ERD

The database analyst gains a better understanding of the data to be contained in the database through the step of constructing the ERD.
The ERD serves as a documentation tool.
Finally, the ERD is used to connect the logical structure of the database to users. In particular, the ERD effectively communicates the logic of the database to users.
